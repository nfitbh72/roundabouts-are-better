I’m sorry
You probably downloaded this game because you love roundabouts
This is a game of why roundabouts are better, and I’ll prove it to you
But to do that, we need to use traffic lights
Why?  Because if I built a traffic simulator, you’d do the sensible thing
You’d just put a roundabout down, job done, high score for you.
So instead, this is a game about traffic lights…

create the basic framework for our game.

we need:
- an intro screen - display the text in assets/txt/intro.txt in white text on a back background - we move to the title screen by clicking LMB or space/enter
- a title screen - which displays "Roundabouts Are Better" in large text (white on back background) with "Play", "Settings" and "Exit" buttons
- the exit button should exit the game and close the application

in the future, play button will start the game, dont start this yet
